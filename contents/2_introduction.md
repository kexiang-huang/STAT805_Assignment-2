1. Introduction
Water distribution network links individuals to the network sources through hydraulic elements consist of pumps, valves, tanks and pipes. An adequate water distribution network should not only satisfy the demand in the certain residential area but also minimize the cost of water delivery. Hence, it possesses significant practical and economic value to select a suitable network for the water industry.
The research object in this report is Suez Town’s water industry. The purpose of this case study can be divided into two components as well as three extensions. The major part is to obtain a schedule optimization to minimize the cost of water distribution in 24 hours by linear programing method, while the volume of water in the beginning of the day is the same or similar as the end of the day. Another branch is a cost benefit analysis in order to explore the correlation between pumps’ efficiency upgrading and the cost which can be reduced. Furthermore, the shifting requirement of infrastructure is considered as a correspondence to the growing population and the demand of water in Suez Town. Three extended constraints included the frequency of flow rate change in water source, the time limitation of pumps’ working and the extra constraints in each Flow Control Valve (FCV). The variable used in this report included pump schedule, sources schedule, valves schedule, valves open, source change property and valve open property.
